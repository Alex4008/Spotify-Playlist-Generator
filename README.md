# Spotify-Playlist-Generator
An interactive web app that interfaces through the Spotify API to generate a user a custom playlist based of an algorithm

I'm currently working on a new version of this application. Moving away from a "school project" and towards a "professonal application"
With that being said, this is very much still a WIP, with this current version not the same as what is hosted at http://spotify.alexdgray.com
